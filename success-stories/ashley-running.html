                        <h2>The Injury</h2>
                        <p>I was descending a rocky single-track trail when my left foot caught a root. My body rotated but my knee didn't follow. I felt a pop, collapsed, and lay there staring at the trees, knowing my running life had just changed.</p>
                        <p>The hike out was 3 miles, hopping on one leg with trekking poles. By the time I reached the trailhead, my knee was the size of a grapefruit. The ER confirmed what I already suspected: complete ACL rupture.</p>
                        <p>Trail running was my therapy, my meditation, my identity. I'd log 40-50 miles a week, chasing sunrises on ridgelines. The thought of losing that was harder than the physical pain.</p>

                    <section class="story-section">
                        <h2>Choosing a Graft</h2>
                        <p>My surgeon recommended the quad tendon graft. For runners, it made sense: no hamstring weakness (important for uphills), less anterior knee pain than BTB, and a large, strong graft. The main consideration was protecting the quad during early rehab.</p>
                        <p>I scheduled surgery for a month out and threw myself into prehab. Stationary bike, quad exercises, hamstring curls—anything to go into surgery as strong as possible. Studies show prehab improves outcomes; I wasn't leaving anything to chance.</p>

                        <h2>Early Recovery</h2>
                        <p>The first weeks were about managing expectations. I couldn't do anything I normally did for exercise. I learned to find satisfaction in small things: successfully firing my quad, gaining 5 degrees of flexion, making it through a day without pain medication.</p>
                        <p>By week 3, I was off crutches. Week 4, I was on the stationary bike. The bike became my lifeline—finally, something resembling cardio. I'd ride for an hour watching running documentaries, which was simultaneously inspiring and torturous.</p>

                        <h2>The Quad Awakening</h2>
                        <p>With a quad graft, the quadriceps muscle takes a significant hit. By week 3, my surgical thigh was noticeably smaller than my other leg—quad atrophy is real and visible. This bothered me more than I expected.</p>
                        <p>Rebuilding quad strength became my obsession. Quad sets, straight leg raises, terminal knee extensions, mini squats, step-ups—hours of quad-focused work. By month 3, the size was starting to come back. By month 5, my legs looked nearly symmetrical again.</p>

                        <p>I was cleared to start jogging at 4 months. The first "run" was more of a shuffling waddle—30 seconds on, 4 minutes walking, repeat. My gait felt asymmetrical, my cadence was off, and I was hyperaware of every sensation in my knee.</p>
                        <p>But I was running. Sort of.</p>
                        <p>The progression felt agonizingly slow for someone used to running 50 miles a week:</p>

                        <h2>The Mental Game</h2>
                        <p>Running on flat surfaces felt safe quickly. But trails—my true love—were terrifying. Every rock looked like a potential re-injury. Every root was a threat. My brain wouldn't let me run fluidly; I was constantly bracing for disaster.</p>
                        <p>I started with the flattest, most groomed trails I could find. Gradually added gentle terrain. Used trekking poles initially for confidence. Slowly, trust returned. By month 7, I was running technical single-track again—not fast, but running.</p>

                        <p>By month 8, I was running an hour continuously on trails. By month 9, I did my first 10-mile trail run since injury. It was slow, I took more walk breaks than old me would have, but crossing that distance marker felt monumental.</p>
                        <p>The interesting thing? My legs were more balanced now than before injury. All that single-leg work, all that focused strength training—I'd built a more resilient body. My left leg, previously my weaker side, was now as strong as my right.</p>

                        <p>18 months post-surgery, I lined up for a 50K ultramarathon—a distance I'd never attempted even before injury. The course had 6,000 feet of climbing, technical sections, and everything that once scared me.</p>
                        <p>I finished in 7 hours and 12 minutes. Not fast by any measure, but I crossed that line on two strong legs, tears streaming down my face. A year and a half earlier, I'd wondered if I'd ever run a mile again.</p>
                        <p>The ACL tear didn't end my running career. It transformed it. I'm a smarter, stronger, more grateful runner now.</p>
