                        <h2>The First Time</h2>
                        <p>My first ACL tear happened at 23, playing college soccer. Standard story: planted, pivoted, pop. I had a hamstring autograft reconstruction and did everything "right." Full rehab, passed return-to-sport testing, returned to play at 10 months.</p>
                        <p>Looking back, I should have waited longer. My quad was at 87% LSI—below the recommended 90%—but I was eager and my surgeon cleared me. I thought I was invincible. I was wrong.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section class="story-section">
                        <h2>The Re-Tear</h2>
                        <p>Eighteen months after my first surgery, it happened again. Different game, same knee, same pop. I knew immediately what it was. The MRI confirmed what I already felt: complete ACL graft rupture.</p>
                        <p>The devastation of a re-tear is different from the first injury. The first time, you're shocked but hopeful. You've seen people come back. The second time, you question everything. Did I do something wrong? Is my body broken? Will this ever end?</p>

                            <h3>Re-Injury Reality</h3>
                            <p>Young athletes returning to cutting sports have a 15-25% risk of second ACL injury (to either knee) within 2-3 years. Risk factors include returning before meeting all criteria, insufficient quad strength, and poor landing mechanics. My case was likely a combination of early return and inadequate strength.</p>

                        <h2>Deciding on Revision</h2>
                        <p>Revision ACL surgery is more complex than primary reconstruction. My surgeon explained the challenges:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The old tunnels needed to heal before new ones could be placed</li>
                            <li>I'd already used my hamstring graft</li>
                            <li>Outcomes for revision surgery are generally less favorable than primary</li>
                            <li>The recovery would be longer and harder</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Despite all that, I chose to proceed. I was 25, and I wasn't ready to give up on sports. My surgeon recommended a staged approach: first, a procedure to bone graft the old tunnels, then the revision reconstruction 4 months later.</p>

                        <div class="story-highlight">
                            <h3>My Revision Approach</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Stage 1:</strong> Tunnel bone grafting (outpatient procedure)</li>
                                <li><strong>Recovery:</strong> 4 months of healing</li>
                                <li><strong>Stage 2:</strong> Revision reconstruction with allograft + BTB autograft</li>
                                <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> Using both graft types for maximum strength</li>

                        <h2>The Long Road</h2>
                        <p>From re-injury to full return took 2 years. Not 12 months. Not 18 months. Two full years of work, waiting, and rebuilding.</p>
                        <p>The first four months—waiting for tunnels to heal—were mentally brutal. I couldn't even start rebuilding yet. I did upper body work, cardio on the arm bike, and tried to stay sane. I saw a sports psychologist regularly, which was probably the most important intervention of my entire recovery.</p>
                        <p>After the revision surgery, I approached rehab differently. This time, I wasn't rushing. I didn't care about timelines. I cared about criteria. Every box would be checked before I returned to anything.</p>

                        <p>My first rehab wasn't bad, but it wasn't complete. Here's what I did differently the second time:</p>

                                <p>I didn't just hit 90% LSI—I pushed for 95%+. I wanted my surgical leg to be as strong as possible, not just "good enough."</p>

                        <p>I won't sugarcoat it: revision recovery nearly broke me. There were weeks I didn't want to go to PT. There were nights I cried from frustration. There were moments I questioned whether any sport was worth this.</p>
                        <p>What got me through:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Therapy:</strong> My sports psychologist helped me process grief, fear, and frustration</li>

                            <p>It's okay to grieve. It's okay to be angry. This is genuinely hard. But people do come back from revision surgery. It takes longer, it requires more patience, and it demands more mental work—but it's possible. I'm proof.</p>

                        <p>I returned to competitive soccer at 24 months post-revision, 42 months after my initial injury. I was 27. I'd spent my mid-20s in recovery.</p>
                        <p>My return was cautious. I played in a less competitive league than before. I wear a brace every time I play. I limit myself to one game per week. I warm up meticulously and never play tired.</p>
                        <p>Is it the same as before? No. But I'm playing. I never thought I would again.</p>

                        <p>It's been 3 years since my revision surgery. I play recreational soccer 1-2 times per week. I hike, I run, I go to the gym. My knee is stable. It's not perfect—I have some stiffness and occasional aching—but it's functional.</p>
                        <p>The experience changed me. I'm less reckless. I listen to my body. I prioritize strength training and maintenance. I'll never take playing for granted again.</p>
                        <p>More than that, I learned I'm stronger than I thought. When my first graft failed, I thought my athletic life was over. It wasn't. I rebuilt, twice. If I can do that, I can handle anything.</p>
