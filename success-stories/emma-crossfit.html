                        <h2>The "You're Too Old For This" Moment</h2>
                        <p>I tore my ACL doing a box jump—a movement I'd done thousands of times. Landed awkwardly, felt the pop, and sat on the gym floor thinking, "I'm 42. Maybe this is the universe telling me to act my age."</p>
                        <p>The internet wasn't encouraging. Forums were full of people suggesting I "just do yoga" or "take up swimming" at my age. But I'd been doing CrossFit for 5 years. It was my stress relief, my community, my identity. I wasn't ready to give that up.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section class="story-section">
                        <h2>Finding the Right Surgeon</h2>
                        <p>The first orthopedic surgeon I saw suggested I consider not having surgery. "At your age, if you're not doing competitive sports, you could manage with a brace and physical therapy."</p>
                        <p>I sought a second opinion from a sports medicine specialist who worked with athletes of all ages. Her response was different: "If you want to return to CrossFit, you need the surgery. And yes, you can absolutely do this at 42."</p>
                        <p>We chose a hamstring graft. Her reasoning: good outcomes, less anterior knee pain than BTB (important for all the kneeling in CrossFit), and my hamstrings were strong from years of training.</p>

                    <section class="story-section">
                        <h2>The Age Factor</h2>
                        <p>Let me be honest about what was harder at 42 compared to what I've read from younger recoveries:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Healing took longer:</strong> Swelling stuck around more stubbornly</li>
                            <li><strong>Stiffness was real:</strong> Mornings were rough for the first few months</li>
                            <li><strong>Sleep disruption hit harder:</strong> My body doesn't bounce back from poor sleep like it did at 25</li>
                            <li><strong>Patience was tested:</strong> Waiting felt even harder knowing I have fewer "prime" years ahead</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>But there were advantages too:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Discipline:</strong> I did my exercises religiously. No skipping days.</li>
                            <li><strong>Perspective:</strong> I'd been through hard things before. I knew this would pass.</li>
                            <li><strong>Resources:</strong> I could afford the best PT, equipment, and nutrition.</li>
                            <li><strong>Motivation:</strong> I wasn't taking fitness for granted anymore.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <h3>To Others Over 40</h3>
                            <p>Recovery is possible at any age. Yes, it might take longer. Yes, you might need more rest. But the idea that you're "too old" for ACL surgery is outdated. Work with practitioners who believe in your goals.</p>

                        <h2>Modified CrossFit Throughout</h2>
                        <p>One thing I refused to do was stop going to the gym entirely. From week 3 post-op, I was back in my CrossFit box, doing whatever I could:</p>

                        <h3>Month 1: Upper Body Only</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Seated dumbbell press</li>
                            <li>Ring rows (feet down)</li>
                            <li>Seated bike for "cardio"</li>
                            <li>Core work lying down</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Month 2-3: Adding More</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Rowing machine (with PT clearance)</li>
                            <li>Air squats (partial range)</li>
                            <li>Step-ups (low box)</li>
                            <li>Banded movements</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Month 4-6: Getting Creative</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Full squats with weight</li>
                            <li>Deadlifts returning</li>
                            <li>Box step-ups instead of box jumps</li>
                            <li>Assault bike intervals</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Every workout was modified, but I was still part of my community. That social connection was medicine for my mental health.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section class="story-section">
                        <h2>The Hamstring Challenge</h2>
                        <p>With a hamstring graft, my hamstrings were weak for a while. This affected:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Deadlifts:</strong> Had to rebuild from much lighter weight</li>
                            <li><strong>Running:</strong> Hamstrings fatigued quickly initially</li>
                            <li><strong>Glute-ham raises:</strong> Couldn't do these for months</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Nordic curls became my best friend. I started with heavy band assistance and progressed slowly. By month 8, I was doing unassisted nordics—something I couldn't do even before injury.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section class="story-section">
                        <h2>Box Jumps: The Final Boss</h2>
                        <p>Box jumps were my white whale. They'd caused the injury. The thought of jumping onto a box terrified me.</p>
                        <p>My PT designed a progression:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Month 5:</strong> Jumping rope (low-level plyometrics)</li>
                            <li><strong>Month 6:</strong> Line hops, broad jumps onto crash mat</li>
                            <li><strong>Month 7:</strong> Box step-ups with speed, small box jumps (12")</li>
                            <li><strong>Month 8:</strong> 16" box jumps, stepping down</li>
                            <li><strong>Month 9:</strong> 20" box jumps, stepping down</li>
                            <li><strong>Month 10:</strong> Rebounding box jumps (low)</li>
                            <li><strong>Month 11:</strong> Full WOD box jumps</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The first time I did box jumps in a WOD, I cried during the workout. Not from pain—from relief and joy.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section class="story-section">
                        <h2>Return to Full WODs</h2>
                        <p>At 12 months, I completed my first RX workout since injury—"Cindy" (AMRAP 20: 5 pull-ups, 10 push-ups, 15 air squats). My score was lower than my pre-injury PR, but I did it with perfect movement and zero fear.</p>
                        <p>Now, at 43, I'm lifting heavier than before injury. My back squat PR increased by 20 lbs. My running is smoother. I'm more balanced, more aware of my body, more intentional about warm-ups and recovery.</p>
