                        <h2>The Injury</h2>
                        <p>At 35, I wasn't supposed to be the guy getting injured. I'd played pickup basketball for 15 years without a serious injury. Just some ankle sprains, minor stuff. Then, during a casual Wednesday night game, I landed awkwardly from a layup and felt that dreaded pop.</p>
                        <p>The MRI showed a complete ACL tear. My first thought wasn't about basketball—it was about my kids. Could I still run around with them? Coach their little league games? The doctor assured me I could, but I'd need surgery and a lot of work.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section class="story-section">
                        <h2>The Age Question</h2>
                        <p>I did a lot of research before surgery, and I kept reading that outcomes are "worse" for older patients. At 35, I wasn't old—but I wasn't 22 either. My surgeon was straightforward: age matters less than commitment. If I did the work, I'd recover. If I didn't, I wouldn't.</p>
                        <p>He recommended a hamstring autograft. Patellar tendon is sometimes preferred for younger athletes, but hamstring has less donor site pain and I wasn't trying to go pro. I trusted his judgment.</p>

                            <h3>What I Learned About Age & ACL Recovery</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Biology slows slightly, but not dramatically, in your 30s</li>
                                <li>Life responsibilities (work, family) make rehab harder to prioritize</li>
                                <li>Maturity helps with patience—I wasn't tempted to rush back</li>
                                <li>Recovery is possible at any age with proper commitment</li>
                            </ul>

                        <h2>Early Recovery</h2>
                        <p>The first two weeks were humbling. I couldn't do simple tasks without help. My wife became my caregiver on top of everything else she was doing. The guilt was real—I felt like a burden.</p>
                        <p>Physical therapy started at week 1, and I approached it like a job. Twice a week in the clinic, exercises at home every day. I set up a PT station in my garage: foam roller, resistance bands, ankle weights, a small step for exercises. Having a dedicated space helped me stay consistent.</p>

                        <h2>The Long Middle</h2>
                        <p>Months 2-5 were the grind. I could walk normally, I looked fine, but I was nowhere near basketball. My quad was visibly smaller than my other leg. The hamstring on my surgical side felt weak. Progress was measurable but slow.</p>
                        <p>I kept a spreadsheet tracking my single-leg press numbers, leg extension weights, and balance test times. Watching the numbers creep up week after week kept me motivated when the day-to-day felt static.</p>

                            <p>I invested about $500 in equipment that let me do PT at home:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Adjustable dumbbells</li>

                        <h2>Mental Health Matters</h2>
                        <p>Around month 4, I hit a wall. I was irritable with my family, dreading PT, and questioning whether basketball was even worth it anymore. Looking back, I recognize it as depression—but at the time, I just thought I was weak.</p>
                        <p>My PT noticed and suggested I talk to someone. I resisted at first, but eventually saw a sports psychologist for a few sessions. It helped more than I expected. She gave me tools for dealing with the frustration and helped me reframe my goals.</p>
                        <p>I stopped asking "when will I be back?" and started asking "what can I do today?" That shift made a huge difference.</p>

                    <section class="story-section">
                        <h2>Running and Beyond</h2>
                        <p>I started jogging at month 5. It felt strange—my brain wasn't trusting my leg, even though it was physically ready. The first few weeks were more about confidence than fitness. I ran on a treadmill exclusively, which let me control speed and stop immediately if needed.</p>
                        <p>By month 7, I was running outdoors and had started lateral movement drills. The first time I did a defensive slide without thinking about my knee was a revelation. The trust was building.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section class="story-section">
                        <h2>Basketball-Specific Training</h2>
                        <p>Months 8-11 were focused on basketball movements. I worked with a trainer who specialized in return-to-sport, and we built a progression:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Shooting drills (stationary, then moving)</li>
                            <li>Dribbling with direction changes</li>
                            <li>Layups and jump shots</li>
                            <li>1-on-1 with light defense</li>
                            <li>3-on-3 half court</li>
                            <li>5-on-5 controlled scrimmage</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Each step took 2-3 weeks. When I felt confident at one level, we moved up. There was no rushing—I'd waited too long to blow it now.</p>

                    <section class="story-section">
                        <h2>Return-to-Sport Testing</h2>
                        <p>At month 11, I did formal testing:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Quad strength:</strong> 91% LSI</li>
                            <li><strong>Hamstring strength:</strong> 88% LSI (hamstring graft takes longer)</li>
                            <li><strong>Single hop:</strong> 93% LSI</li>
                            <li><strong>Triple hop:</strong> 90% LSI</li>
                            <li><strong>ACL-RSI:</strong> 74</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>My hamstring was slightly below the 90% threshold, but my surgeon and PT agreed it was close enough given my progress trajectory. We scheduled my return for month 12.</p>

                        <h2>First Game Back</h2>
                        <p>I returned at exactly 12 months post-surgery. It wasn't the same pickup game where I got hurt—I intentionally chose a different group, different court. Fresh start.</p>
                        <p>I played conservatively. Took outside shots instead of driving. Played more zone than man defense. When the game got physical under the basket, I stayed on the perimeter. It wasn't pretty basketball, but I was playing.</p>
                        <p>After the game, I sat in my car and called my wife. "I did it," I told her. She'd been there through every frustrating PT session, every moment of doubt. She cried. I cried a little too.</p>

                    <section class="story-section">
                        <h2>Two Years Later</h2>
                        <p>It's been two years since my surgery. I play pickup basketball once a week, sometimes twice. I'm more cautious than before—I wear a brace, I warm up properly, I don't play when I'm tired. But I'm playing.</p>
                        <p>More importantly, I can run with my kids. I coached my daughter's basketball team last season. I'm active in ways that matter to my life, not just my hobby.</p>
                        <p>The injury forced me to take my body seriously. I strength train now. I stretch. I pay attention to how I feel. In a weird way, I'm more athletic at 37 than I was at 35—just in a smarter, more sustainable way.</p>
