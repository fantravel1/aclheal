                        <h2>The Injury</h2>
                        <p>It happened on a rainy Tuesday night in a men's league game—the kind of match that shouldn't have mattered. I planted to change direction, felt a pop, and knew immediately something was very wrong. The MRI confirmed my worst fear: complete ACL tear, plus a small meniscus tear that would need repair.</p>
                        <p>The drive home from the orthopedic office was a blur. Soccer had been part of my identity for 20 years. I'd played through college, joined competitive adult leagues, and organized pickup games every weekend. Who was I without it?</p>
                    </section>

                    <section class="story-section">
                        <h2>Surgery Decision</h2>
                        <p>My surgeon gave me the graft options, and I chose BTB (bone-patellar tendon-bone). He explained it was the "gold standard" for athletes wanting to return to cutting sports. The downsides—anterior knee pain, kneeling discomfort—seemed worth it for the strongest fixation and fastest graft incorporation.</p>
                        <p>Surgery was scheduled for three weeks out. I used that time for prehab: quad sets, heel slides, and stationary bike every day. My surgeon said coming in strong would mean faster recovery. He was right.</p>

                    <section class="story-section">
                        <h2>The First Two Weeks</h2>
                        <p>Nothing prepares you for those first days. The nerve block wore off at 3am, and I understood what real pain felt like. The ice machine became my best friend. I set alarms to do quad sets every hour while awake—not because I wanted to, but because I knew extension was the priority.</p>
                        <p>By day 10, I could fire my quad on command. Small victory, but it felt huge. PT started twice weekly, and my therapist became equal parts coach and therapist.</p>

                            <h3>What Helped Most</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Ice machine (worth every penny)</li>
                                <li>Sleeping slightly reclined with pillows</li>
                                <li>Compression to manage swelling</li>
                                <li>Having meals prepped before surgery</li>
                            </ul>

                        <h2>Months 1-3: The Grind</h2>
                        <p>This phase was monotonous. Heel slides, quad sets, straight leg raises, mini squats, step-ups—repeated hundreds of times. I tracked everything in a notebook: range of motion, sets, reps, pain levels. Seeing the numbers improve kept me going.</p>
                        <p>Full extension came by week 3. Flexion was harder—I hit 90 degrees at week 4, 120 at week 8, and full flexion around week 10. The meniscus repair meant I was restricted from full flexion initially, which tested my patience.</p>
                        <p>Around month 2, I started feeling almost normal for daily activities. That's when the mental battle really began—feeling physically capable but knowing the graft wasn't ready for sport.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section class="story-section">
                        <h2>Month 4: The Low Point</h2>
                        <p>Month 4 was my darkest period. I could walk fine, my leg looked normal, but I was nowhere near return to sport. Watching my team play without me was brutal. I started questioning if I'd ever get back, if it was even worth trying.</p>
                        <p>What saved me was connecting with others online who'd been through it. Reading stories of successful returns, understanding that month 4 funk was universal—it normalized my experience. I wasn't weak for struggling; I was human.</p>

                        <div class="info-card important">
                            <h3>If You're in Month 4...</h3>
                            <p>It gets better. This is statistically the hardest point mentally. The light at the end of the tunnel is there, even when you can't see it. Keep showing up. Keep doing the boring work. Your future self will thank you.</p>
                        </div>

                    <section class="story-section">
                        <h2>Months 5-7: Running and Building</h2>
                        <p>Clearance to jog at month 4.5 felt like Christmas morning. I started with a walk-jog protocol: 4 minutes walking, 1 minute jogging, repeat. Those first jogging minutes felt awkward and mechanical, but within two weeks, my gait normalized.</p>
                        <p>By month 6, I was running continuously for 20+ minutes. We added plyometrics—box jumps, lateral hops, the exercises that actually look like soccer. Each successful landing built confidence.</p>
                        <p>Strength testing at month 6 showed 78% quad symmetry. Not quite the 90% goal for return, but progress. I doubled down on leg press, split squats, and single-leg work.</p>

                    <section class="story-section">
                        <h2>Months 8-10: Sport-Specific Training</h2>
                        <p>This is where rehab became fun again. Dribbling drills, passing, shooting—actual soccer movements. No defenders at first, just me and cones. Then controlled 1v1s with teammates who knew not to tackle hard.</p>
                        <p>The cutting progressions were carefully structured:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Anticipatory cuts (knowing exactly when to change direction)</li>
                            <li>Reactive cuts (responding to visual cues)</li>
                            <li>Sport-specific scenarios (reacting to defenders)</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Each phase built on the last. By month 9, I was doing full-speed direction changes without thinking about my knee.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section class="story-section">
                        <h2>Return to Sport Testing</h2>
                        <p>At month 10, I completed formal return-to-sport testing:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Quad strength:</strong> 92% LSI (goal: &gt;90%)</li>
                            <li><strong>Hamstring strength:</strong> 95% LSI</li>
                            <li><strong>Single hop:</strong> 94% LSI</li>
                            <li><strong>Triple hop:</strong> 91% LSI</li>
                            <li><strong>ACL-RSI:</strong> 76 (goal: &gt;70)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>I passed everything. My surgeon and PT cleared me for full return. But clearance and readiness aren't the same thing.</p>

                    <section class="story-section">
                        <h2>First Game Back</h2>
                        <p>I played my first full match at 11 months post-op. Started on the bench intentionally—I wanted to see the game flow first, get my head right.</p>
                        <p>When I stepped on the field, my heart was pounding harder than any warmup. The first ball came to me, I trapped it, played a simple pass. Nothing fancy. Nothing dramatic. Just playing.</p>
                        <p>Slowly, my instincts returned. By the second half, I wasn't thinking about my knee at all. Just playing the game I loved.</p>
                        <p>I scored the winning goal in the 85th minute. A simple tap-in, nothing highlight-worthy. But when the ball hit the net, 11 months of pain, doubt, and grinding flashed before me. I cried on the field. My teammates probably thought I was crazy celebrating a rec league goal like that. They didn't understand—it wasn't about the goal.</p>

                    <section class="story-section">
                        <h2>Where I Am Now</h2>
                        <p>It's been two years since surgery. I play twice a week without issues. My knee occasionally gets stiff after hard games, and I can't kneel on hard surfaces for long (classic BTB side effect), but functionally I'm 100%.</p>
                        <p>The experience changed me. I appreciate playing in a way I never did before. I'm also more careful—better warmups, listening to fatigue, not playing through every minor tweak. Ironic that tearing my ACL made me a smarter athlete.</p>
