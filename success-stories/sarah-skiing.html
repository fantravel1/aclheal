                        <h2>The Injury</h2>
                        <p>I've been skiing since I was 3. It's not just what I do—it's who I am. I became a certified instructor at 18, moved to Colorado at 22, and built my whole life around the mountains. I was on my skis 150+ days a year.</p>
                        <p>The injury happened in late January, on a run I'd done a thousand times. I was demonstrating a carved turn for an advanced student when I caught an edge on some unexpected ice. My ski didn't release, my knee twisted, and I heard the pop that every skier dreads.</p>
                        <p>I knew immediately. I sat in the snow for what felt like forever, staring at the mountain I loved, wondering if I'd ever ski it again.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section class="story-section">
                        <h2>The Stakes</h2>
                        <p>For most people, an ACL tear is a sports injury. For me, it was a career crisis. Ski instructing was my livelihood. The season was halfway done, and I'd miss the rest of it—that was guaranteed. But would I come back at all?</p>
                        <p>My surgeon understood what was at stake. He recommended a quad tendon graft, which was newer but had excellent outcomes. The quad tendon is thicker than the patellar tendon, and the fixation is strong. It was the right choice for someone who needed to trust their knee on steep terrain.</p>

                        <div class="story-highlight">
                            <h3>Why I Chose Quad Tendon</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Strong, thick graft (9-10mm possible)</li>
                                <li>Less anterior knee pain than patellar tendon</li>
                                <li>Good for high-demand athletes</li>
                                <li>My surgeon had excellent outcomes with it</li>
                            </ul>

                        <h2>Summer of Rehab</h2>
                        <p>My surgery was in early February, which meant I had a full off-season to recover. I threw myself into rehab like it was my new full-time job—because it was. I lost my teaching income, but I'd saved enough to get through if I was disciplined.</p>
                        <p>I was at PT three times a week, and I did 1-2 hours of home exercises daily. I became obsessed with regaining my quad strength—the quad tendon donor site meant that muscle needed extra attention.</p>
                        <p>By summer, I was hiking the mountains I usually skied. Not the same, but it kept me connected to the environment I loved.</p>

                    <section class="story-section">
                        <h2>The Mental Game</h2>
                        <p>The physical rehab was hard, but the mental part was harder. Skiing is my identity. Without it, I felt lost. I'd walk through town and see tourists heading to the lifts, and I'd feel this deep ache.</p>
                        <p>I started seeing a therapist who specialized in athletes. She helped me understand that my worth wasn't tied to skiing—even though it felt that way. I learned to find joy in the process of recovery, not just the goal of returning.</p>
                        <p>The biggest shift came when I started helping other injured skiers in an online community. Sharing what I'd learned gave me purpose during the hardest months.</p>

                            <h3>Finding Purpose During Recovery</h3>
                            <p>If your sport is your identity, losing it temporarily can feel devastating. Finding other ways to contribute—coaching, mentoring, learning—can help bridge the gap. Your knowledge and passion don't disappear with an injury.</p>

                        <h2>Pre-Season Preparation</h2>
                        <p>By September—7 months post-surgery—I was focused on ski-specific preparation. My PT designed a program that simulated skiing demands:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Wall sits for sustained quad endurance</li>
                            <li>Lateral bounds for edge-to-edge power</li>
                            <li>Single-leg balance on unstable surfaces</li>
                            <li>Eccentric training for handling variable terrain</li>
                            <li>Reaction drills for unexpected situations</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>I also used a ski simulator—basically a slide board with foot plates—to practice the lateral movements of skiing without the impact.</p>

                    <section class="story-section">
                        <h2>Return to Snow</h2>
                        <p>I got back on skis at 10 months, in early December. My surgeon required specific criteria: quad LSI over 90%, hop tests over 90%, and psychological readiness. I met everything, barely.</p>
                        <p>The first day was emotional. I started on the bunny hill—literally the same place I take beginners. It felt ridiculous and wonderful at the same time. My first turns were tentative, almost robotic. But by the end of the day, I was cruising greens and feeling something I'd almost forgotten: joy.</p>

                        <p>I returned to teaching at 11 months, right after the new year. My supervisor was supportive—she'd been through an ACL herself years ago. We agreed I'd start with beginner lessons only, which was actually perfect. Low speeds, controlled environment, lots of standing around.</p>
                        <p>Gradually, I worked up to intermediate and advanced lessons. By late February, I was teaching at my full capacity. The season I thought was over became one of my best ever—not despite the injury, but because of how it changed my approach.</p>

                    <section class="story-section">
                        <h2>What Changed</h2>
                        <p>I'm a different skier now. More aware. I pay attention to conditions in a way I didn't before. I warm up properly every day, even when I'm tired. I don't push through fatigue the way I used to.</p>
                        <p>I also teach differently. When I have students who are scared, I understand them now. Fear is valid. I teach them to work with it, not ignore it.</p>
                        <p>The injury cost me one season and gave me perspective that will last a lifetime.</p>
