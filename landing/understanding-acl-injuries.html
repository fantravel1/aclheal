The ACL connects the thigh bone (femur) to the shin bone (tibia) and provides rotational stability. Tears range from partial (some fibers intact) to complete ruptures. About 200,000 ACL injuries occur annually in the US, with 70% being non-contact injuries during sports involving pivoting, jumping, or sudden direction changes."

                    "text": "Hearing a pop is one of the classic signs of an ACL tear—approximately 70% of people with ACL tears report hearing or feeling a pop at the time of injury. However, a pop alone doesn't confirm an ACL tear, as other knee structures can also produce this sound. Additional signs suggesting an ACL tear include: immediate swelling within 2-6 hours, difficulty bearing weight, knee feeling unstable or 'giving way,' and significant pain. See an orthopedic specialist for proper diagnosis—they'll perform physical tests (Lachman test) and likely order an MRI."

Some people can walk on a torn ACL once initial swelling subsides, but the knee may feel unstable during pivoting movements.

A complete ACL tear means the ligament is fully ruptured with no remaining connection. Partial tears may heal with physical therapy and bracing in some cases, while complete tears typically require surgical reconstruction for active individuals. The treatment decision depends on the degree of knee instability, your activity level, and goals. MRI can help determine tear extent, but functional testing is also important."

Walking in a straight line doesn't require ACL function—the ACL primarily provides rotational stability and prevents the shin from sliding forward. However, you may experience: knee instability during twisting or pivoting, unexpected giving way episodes, and difficulty with stairs or uneven terrain. Being able to walk doesn't indicate injury severity—you can have a complete tear and walk normally. The concern is cutting, jumping, and pivoting activities."

May heal without surgery depending on symptoms and activity level, or may require reconstruction. Grade 3 (Complete Tear): The ligament is completely ruptured. Significant instability.

This can happen with: partial tears that involve less bleeding, chronic/old tears, or tears where blood drains out of the joint capsule. Lack of significant swelling doesn't rule out an ACL tear. If you heard a pop, have instability, or experienced a mechanism consistent with ACL injury, seek evaluation regardless of swelling amount. Some partial tears have less dramatic presentations."

An ACL sprain specifically refers to ligament damage (ligaments connect bone to bone) and is the correct medical term for ACL injuries—technically, all ACL tears are sprains classified by grade (1, 2, or 3). A strain refers to muscle or tendon injuries (connecting muscle to bone), so technically you cannot 'strain' your ACL. In common usage, people often use these terms interchangeably, but medically: ACL tear = ACL sprain = ACL injury, and strain refers to muscle/tendon injuries."

However, not everyone needs surgery. Non-surgical treatment may work for: older adults with lower activity demands, people who don't participate in cutting/pivoting sports, those with stable knees despite the tear, and some partial tears. The ACL won't regenerate, but muscles around the knee can be strengthened to compensate. Surgery is typically recommended for active individuals wanting to return to sports."

ACL (Anterior Cruciate Ligament): Located inside the knee, prevents forward sliding and rotation, poor blood supply so doesn't heal, usually requires surgery for active people. MCL (Medial Collateral Ligament): Located on the inner side of the knee, prevents sideways bending, has good blood supply and often heals without surgery, usually caused by direct blows to outer knee. ACL tears often occur during non-contact pivoting; MCL tears often from contact. Both can occur together in severe injuries."

Multiple factors contribute: Anatomical: Women have wider pelvises (increasing Q-angle), narrower intercondylar notches, and smaller ACLs. Hormonal: Estrogen may affect ligament laxity, with some studies showing increased injury risk during certain menstrual cycle phases. Biomechanical: Women tend to land with less knee flexion, greater knee valgus (knock-knee), and more upright posture. Neuromuscular: Differences in hamstring/quadriceps activation patterns and strength ratios. Prevention programs can reduce female ACL injury rates by 50-70%."

                    <p>The <strong>ACL (Anterior Cruciate Ligament)</strong> is one of four major ligaments in your knee. It connects your thigh bone (femur) to your shin bone (tibia) and provides crucial stability, especially during:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pivoting and changing direction</li>
                        <li>Jumping and landing</li>
                        <li>Sudden stops and starts</li>
                        <li>Rotational movements</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>An <strong>ACL tear</strong> occurs when this ligament is stretched beyond its capacity or completely ruptured. About <strong>70-80% of ACL tears are non-contact injuries</strong>—meaning they happen without another person hitting your knee.</p>

                        <p>If you heard a pop during a knee injury, it's a significant indicator but not definitive proof of an ACL tear. Here's what to consider:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Pop + rapid swelling + instability</strong> = very likely ACL tear</li>
                            <li>Other structures (meniscus, other ligaments) can also cause a pop</li>
                            <li>Some ACL tears occur without a noticeable pop</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> If you heard a pop and have significant symptoms, see an orthopedic specialist for proper evaluation.</p>

                <p>So technically, you can't "strain" your ACL—it would be a sprain. However, in everyday language, people often use these terms interchangeably. When communicating with your doctor, the specific grade (1, 2, or 3) matters more than whether you call it a sprain or strain.</p>

                    <p>Multiple factors contribute to higher ACL injury rates in female athletes:</p>

                    <h4>Anatomical Factors</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Wider pelvis</strong> — Increases the Q-angle (angle from hip to knee)</li>
                        <li><strong>Narrower intercondylar notch</strong> — Less space for the ACL</li>
                        <li><strong>Smaller ACL</strong> — May be weaker relative to body size</li>
                        <li><strong>Greater ligament laxity</strong> — More joint looseness on average</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Estrogen may affect ligament strength and laxity</li>
                        <li>Some studies show increased risk during certain menstrual cycle phases</li>
                        <li>Research is ongoing and not fully conclusive</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Biomechanical Factors</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Landing mechanics</strong> — Women tend to land with less knee flexion</li>
                        <li><strong>Knee valgus</strong> — Greater tendency for "knock-knee" position</li>
                        <li><strong>Hip control</strong> — Differences in hip muscle activation</li>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>There's no strict deadline for ACL surgery. Some people have successful reconstruction years after their original injury. However, delaying surgery while continuing activities that cause instability can lead to additional damage (meniscus tears, cartilage damage). Most surgeons recommend reconstruction within 3-6 months for active individuals. Chronic ACL deficiency is associated with higher rates of osteoarthritis.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>A completely torn ACL cannot heal or regenerate on its own. The ACL has poor blood supply and is surrounded by synovial fluid, which prevents healing. However, this doesn't mean everyone needs surgery. Non-surgical management (physical therapy, bracing, activity modification) can work well for people with stable knees who don't participate in high-risk activities. Some partial tears may improve with conservative treatment.</p>

                    <p>At the moment of injury, many people report hearing or feeling a "pop." This is followed by immediate pain that can range from moderate to severe. Within hours, significant swelling typically develops. After the acute phase, the knee may feel unstable or "loose," especially during twisting or pivoting movements. Some describe it as feeling like the knee will buckle or give way. Daily activities like walking may feel relatively normal, but cutting or pivoting feels unreliable.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>ACL tears are diagnosed through a combination of physical examination and imaging. An experienced physician can often diagnose an ACL tear through clinical tests like the Lachman test, anterior drawer test, and pivot shift test. MRI is the gold standard imaging study, with 90-95% accuracy for ACL tears. X-rays may be taken to rule out fractures but cannot show the ACL itself.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Sports with the highest ACL injury rates involve cutting, pivoting, and jumping. The highest risk sports include: soccer (football), basketball, skiing, volleyball, gymnastics, and lacrosse. Female athletes in these sports have particularly high rates. Contact football has high overall knee injury rates but ACL tears specifically are often non-contact. Sports like swimming, cycling, and running have very low ACL injury rates.</p>
