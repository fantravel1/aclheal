Graft failure can occur from new trauma or gradual stretching. If you suspect graft failure, see your surgeon for evaluation—MRI can confirm the diagnosis. Re-tear rates are approximately 6-15% depending on graft type, activity level, and time since surgery."

                    "text": "Knee giving way after ACL surgery can have several causes: 1) Graft failure or re-tear (see surgeon urgently), 2) Muscle weakness—quad weakness is the most common cause of instability sensation even with intact graft, 3) Proprioceptive deficits—the knee hasn't relearned position sense, 4) Other injuries—meniscus tears, cartilage damage, 5) Psychological—fear causing hesitation. If your knee gives way, see your surgeon to rule out graft failure. If the graft is intact, focus on strengthening and neuromuscular training."

Allograft in young patients: higher rates (up to 25%). Autograft: lower rates (6-12%). Returning before 9 months: significantly increased risk. Each month delay up to 9 months reduces risk by ~51%. High-risk sports (soccer, basketball) have higher rates. Proper rehabilitation and meeting return-to-sport criteria can reduce risk."

Common causes include: scar tissue breaking up, fluid movement in the joint, hardware (screws, buttons), and normal joint sounds. Concerning clicking: painful clicking, catching or locking sensations, clicking with instability or giving way, or clicking that limits function. Painless clicking without other symptoms is usually not worrisome but mention it at your follow-up appointments. If clicking is painful or associated with locking, see your surgeon—it may indicate a cyclops lesion or other issue."

At 3-6 months, some swelling after exercise is expected. Concerning swelling: sudden onset, not related to activity, associated with warmth/redness, not responding to rest/ice, or accompanied by fever. Causes of prolonged swelling: overactivity, doing too much too soon, residual inflammation, or underlying issues (infection, cyclops lesion). If swelling persists beyond 6 months or doesn't follow expected patterns, discuss with your surgeon."

Symptoms include: inability to fully straighten the knee (most concerning), significantly limited bending, persistent stiffness despite rehab, and knee feeling 'stuck.' Risk factors: going into surgery with limited motion, inadequate early ROM exercises, prolonged immobilization, and individual healing response. Treatment: aggressive physical therapy, manipulation under anesthesia, or arthroscopic surgery to remove scar tissue. Prevention: achieving full extension before surgery (prehab) and prioritizing extension exercises post-op."

It gets its name from its appearance on MRI (resembling a single eye). Symptoms: loss of full extension, painful clicking or clunking with extension, feeling of something blocking the knee. It occurs in approximately 1-10% of ACL reconstructions. Treatment: arthroscopic surgery to remove the lesion. If you had full extension after surgery but gradually lost it with clicking, a cyclops lesion may be the cause."

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Several potential causes: 1) <strong>Graft failure</strong>—see your surgeon urgently to rule this out. 2) <strong>Muscle weakness</strong>—quad weakness is the most common cause of instability feeling even with intact graft. 3) <strong>Proprioceptive deficits</strong>—the knee hasn't relearned position sense. 4) <strong>Other injuries</strong>—meniscus or cartilage damage. 5) <strong>Psychological</strong>—fear causing hesitation. Get evaluated to confirm graft integrity, then focus on strengthening and neuromuscular training.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Yes, numbness around incision sites is very common after ACL surgery. Small sensory nerves are often cut during the procedure. A small patch of numbness, usually on the outer shin below the knee, is typical and often permanent but rarely problematic. Sensation may gradually improve over 6-12 months but may not fully return. This is usually just a cosmetic issue and doesn't affect function.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Worry about swelling if: it's sudden onset (not related to increased activity), associated with warmth or redness, accompanied by fever, not responding to ice/rest/elevation, worsening rather than improving over time, or accompanied by severe pain. Normal post-op swelling is gradual, activity-related, and responds to ice. If in doubt, contact your surgeon.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Most people don't have issues with hardware (screws, buttons, interference screws), but some do experience: pain over prominent hardware, irritation with certain activities (kneeling), or psychological discomfort knowing it's there. Hardware can be removed after the graft has fully incorporated (usually 1-2 years post-surgery) if it's causing problems. This is a relatively minor procedure but usually not necessary.</p>
