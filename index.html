                    <p><strong>The ACL is located deep inside the center of your knee joint.</strong> It runs diagonally through the middle of the knee, connecting the back of the femur (thigh bone) to the front of the tibia (shin bone).

                    <h3>What Does the ACL Do?</h3>
                    <p><strong>The ACL prevents your shin bone from sliding forward</strong> relative to your thigh bone and controls rotational movements of the knee. It's essential for:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Stopping, pivoting, and changing direction</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>ACL tears most commonly occur during sports that involve sudden stops, jumping, or direction changes.</strong> Common mechanisms include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Non-contact injuries (70-80%):</strong> Pivoting, cutting, or landing awkwardly</li>

                        <li><strong>Deceleration:</strong> Stopping suddenly while running</li>
                        <li><strong>Hyperextension:</strong> Knee bending too far backward</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>No, a completely torn ACL cannot heal or repair itself.</strong> Unlike some other tissues in the body, the ACL has a poor blood supply and is bathed in synovial fluid, which prevents proper healing. Here's what you need to know:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Complete tears:</strong> Will NOT heal without surgical reconstruction</li>
                        <li><strong>Partial tears:</strong> May sometimes heal with bracing and physical therapy, but outcomes vary</li>
                        <li><strong>Non-surgical management:</strong> Possible for low-demand patients who don't do cutting/pivoting sports</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Important:</strong> While the ligament won't heal itself, not everyone needs surgery.

                    <h3>How is ACL Surgery Done?</h3>
                    <p><strong>ACL reconstruction surgery replaces the torn ligament with a tissue graft.</strong> The procedure is typically arthroscopic (minimally invasive):</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Anesthesia:</strong> General or spinal anesthesia is administered</li>
                        <li><strong>Graft harvest:</strong> Tissue is taken from your patellar tendon, hamstring, quadriceps, or a donor (allograft)</li>
                        <li><strong>Tunnel drilling:</strong> Small tunnels are drilled in the femur and tibia</li>
                        <li><strong>Graft placement:</strong> The new ligament is threaded through and secured with screws or buttons</li>
                        <li><strong>Recovery:</strong> Most patients go home the same day</li>
                    </ol>

                <div class="faq-card" id="acl-recovery-time">
                    <h3>How Long is ACL Recovery?</h3>
                    <p><strong>Full ACL recovery typically takes 9-12 months</strong>, though the timeline varies based on graft type, individual healing, and activity goals:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Weeks 0-2:</strong> Pain/swelling management, regaining range of motion</li>
                        <li><strong>Weeks 2-6:</strong> Walking without crutches, full extension</li>
                        <li><strong>Weeks 6-12:</strong> Strength building, stationary cycling</li>
                        <li><strong>Months 3-6:</strong> Running progression, plyometrics</li>
                        <li><strong>Months 6-9:</strong> Sport-specific training, agility drills</li>
                        <li><strong>Months 9-12:</strong> Return-to-sport testing and clearance</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Key insight:</strong> Returning too early significantly increases re-injury risk. Evidence shows waiting at least 9 months reduces re-tear rates. <a href="/education/acl-recovery-timeline.html">View the complete recovery timeline →</a></p>

                <h2>Why This Site Exists</h2>
                <p class="lead">42% of ACL surgery patients develop depression. 76% cite fear as preventing their return to sport. Yet virtually no comprehensive resource exists to guide patients through the complete 9-12 month recovery journey—addressing both physical AND mental health challenges.</p>
