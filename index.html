Walking ability doesn't indicate injury severity—you can have a complete ACL tear and still walk normally. The bigger concern is cutting, jumping, and pivoting activities."

Hamstring: less donor site pain, good outcomes, but may weaken hamstring strength. Quadriceps tendon: thick strong graft, increasingly popular, good for revisions.

However, long-term delay with an unstable knee risks: meniscus tears from repeated giving-way episodes (up to 50% develop new meniscus damage within 5 years without surgery), cartilage damage, and early-onset arthritis. If your knee is stable and you modify activities, delay is less risky. Most surgeons recommend surgery within 3-6 months for active patients."

Research shows patients with better pre-surgery quad strength and full extension recover faster and have better long-term outcomes. Most surgeons recommend 2-6 weeks of prehab."

            <h2>What is the ACL?</h2>
            <p class="section-intro">The Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) is one of the four major ligaments in your knee. Here's everything you need to know about the ACL, injuries, and recovery.</p>

            <div class="acl-faq-grid">
                <!-- What is ACL / What ACL stands for -->
                <div class="faq-card" id="acl-definition">
                    <h3>What Does ACL Stand For?</h3>
                    <p><strong>ACL stands for Anterior Cruciate Ligament.</strong> It is a strong band of tissue (ligament) that connects your thigh bone (femur) to your shin bone (tibia). The word "anterior" means it's located at the front of the knee, and "cruciate" means it crosses (from Latin "crux" meaning cross)—because the ACL crosses over the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) inside your knee joint. <a href="/education/what-is-acl.html">Learn more about the ACL →</a></p>
                </div>

                <!-- Where is ACL located -->
                <div class="faq-card" id="acl-location">
                    <h3>Where is the ACL Located?</h3>
                    <p><strong>The ACL is located deep inside the center of your knee joint.</strong> It runs diagonally through the middle of the knee, connecting the back of the femur (thigh bone) to the front of the tibia (shin bone). The ACL sits behind your kneecap (patella) and works together with three other major ligaments—the PCL, MCL, and LCL—to keep your knee stable.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- What ACL does / What ACL injury is -->
                <div class="faq-card" id="acl-function">
                    <h3>What Does the ACL Do?</h3>
                    <p><strong>The ACL prevents your shin bone from sliding forward</strong> relative to your thigh bone and controls rotational movements of the knee. It's essential for:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Stopping, pivoting, and changing direction</li>
                        <li>Providing stability during cutting and jumping movements</li>
                        <li>Sending signals to your brain about knee position (proprioception)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Without a functioning ACL, the knee can feel unstable and "give way" during physical activity.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- How ACL tear happens -->
                <div class="faq-card" id="acl-tear-causes">
                    <h3>How Does an ACL Tear Happen?</h3>
                    <p><strong>ACL tears most commonly occur during sports that involve sudden stops, jumping, or direction changes.</strong> Common mechanisms include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Non-contact injuries (70-80%):</strong> Pivoting, cutting, or landing awkwardly</li>
                        <li><strong>Contact injuries:</strong> Direct blow to the knee during tackle or collision</li>
                        <li><strong>Deceleration:</strong> Stopping suddenly while running</li>
                        <li><strong>Hyperextension:</strong> Knee bending too far backward</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You may hear a "pop," feel immediate pain, and experience rapid swelling. The knee often feels unstable or gives way.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- Can ACL heal on its own / without surgery -->
                <div class="faq-card highlight" id="acl-healing">
                    <h3>Can an ACL Tear Heal on Its Own?</h3>
                    <p><strong>No, a completely torn ACL cannot heal or repair itself.</strong> Unlike some other tissues in the body, the ACL has a poor blood supply and is bathed in synovial fluid, which prevents proper healing. Here's what you need to know:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Complete tears:</strong> Will NOT heal without surgical reconstruction</li>
                        <li><strong>Partial tears:</strong> May sometimes heal with bracing and physical therapy, but outcomes vary</li>
                        <li><strong>Non-surgical management:</strong> Possible for low-demand patients who don't do cutting/pivoting sports</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Important:</strong> While the ligament won't heal itself, not everyone needs surgery. Some people can function without an ACL through strengthening and activity modification. <a href="/education/can-acl-heal-without-surgery.html">Read the complete guide on ACL healing →</a></p>

                <div class="faq-card" id="acl-surgery">
                    <h3>How is ACL Surgery Done?</h3>
                    <p><strong>ACL reconstruction surgery replaces the torn ligament with a tissue graft.</strong> The procedure is typically arthroscopic (minimally invasive):</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Anesthesia:</strong> General or spinal anesthesia is administered</li>
                        <li><strong>Graft harvest:</strong> Tissue is taken from your patellar tendon, hamstring, quadriceps, or a donor (allograft)</li>
                        <li><strong>Tunnel drilling:</strong> Small tunnels are drilled in the femur and tibia</li>
                        <li><strong>Graft placement:</strong> The new ligament is threaded through and secured with screws or buttons</li>
                        <li><strong>Recovery:</strong> Most patients go home the same day</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Surgery typically takes 60-90 minutes. <a href="/education/surgery-options.html">Learn more about surgery options and graft types →</a></p>

                <!-- ACL recovery timeline -->
                <div class="faq-card" id="acl-recovery-time">
                    <h3>How Long is ACL Recovery?</h3>
                    <p><strong>Full ACL recovery typically takes 9-12 months</strong>, though the timeline varies based on graft type, individual healing, and activity goals:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Weeks 0-2:</strong> Pain/swelling management, regaining range of motion</li>
                        <li><strong>Weeks 2-6:</strong> Walking without crutches, full extension</li>
                        <li><strong>Weeks 6-12:</strong> Strength building, stationary cycling</li>
                        <li><strong>Months 3-6:</strong> Running progression, plyometrics</li>
                        <li><strong>Months 6-9:</strong> Sport-specific training, agility drills</li>
                        <li><strong>Months 9-12:</strong> Return-to-sport testing and clearance</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Key insight:</strong> Returning too early significantly increases re-injury risk. Evidence shows waiting at least 9 months reduces re-tear rates. <a href="/education/acl-recovery-timeline.html">View the complete recovery timeline →</a></p>
