            <div class="info-card highlight-card" style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #fef3c7 0%, #fef9c3 100%); border-left: 4px solid #f59e0b; margin-bottom: var(--spacing-xl);">
                <h2 style="color: #92400e; margin-top: 0;">The Short Answer</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; color: #78350f;"><strong>No, a completely torn ACL cannot heal or repair itself.</strong> The ACL lacks adequate blood supply for self-healing. However, not everyone with a torn ACL requires surgery. Some people can function without an ACL through rehabilitation and activity modification.</p>

            <!-- Why ACL Cannot Heal -->
            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Why Can't the ACL Heal Itself?</h2>
                <p>Unlike bones, muscles, or even some other ligaments, the ACL has unique characteristics that prevent natural healing:</p>

                <div class="info-card">
                    <h3>1. Poor Blood Supply</h3>
                    <p>The ACL has limited blood vessels running through it. Blood supply is essential for healing because it delivers the cells, nutrients, and growth factors needed to repair damaged tissue. Without adequate blood flow, the body cannot mount an effective healing response.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="info-card">
                    <h3>2. Synovial Fluid Environment</h3>
                    <p>The ACL sits inside the knee joint, surrounded by synovial fluid. This fluid is excellent for lubricating the joint but actually <strong>prevents healing</strong> by:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Washing away blood clots that would normally form a healing scaffold</li>
                        <li>Dissolving fibrin (the protein that helps form scar tissue)</li>
                        <li>Keeping the torn ends from staying in contact</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="info-card">
                    <h3>3. Gap Formation</h3>
                    <p>When the ACL tears, the ends retract and separate. Unlike a bone fracture where the pieces can be held together, the torn ACL ends cannot be reconnected and maintained in position for healing.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="info-card">
                    <h3>4. High Mechanical Demands</h3>
                    <p>Even during normal activities, the ACL experiences significant forces. Any attempt at healing would be constantly disrupted by the mechanical stress of everyday knee movement.</p>
                </div>
            </section>

            <!-- What About Partial Tears -->
            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>What About Partial ACL Tears?</h2>
                <p>Partial ACL tears are a gray area. While the ligament still won't "heal" in the true sense, <strong>some partial tears can be successfully managed without surgery</strong>:</p>

                    <p>Many surgeons recommend a <strong>trial of rehabilitation</strong> before deciding on surgery. This approach:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Takes 3-6 months of focused physical therapy</li>

                        <li>Prepares the knee for surgery if needed (prehabilitation)</li>
                        <li>Doesn't worsen outcomes if surgery is later required</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you remain stable and meet your goals without surgery—great. If instability persists, surgery can still be performed.</p>

                <h2>Emerging Treatments: Can We Help the ACL Heal?</h2>
                <p>Researchers are exploring ways to help the ACL heal without full reconstruction:</p>

                <div class="info-card">
                    <h3>Bridge-Enhanced ACL Repair (BEAR)</h3>
                    <p>A newer technique that uses a bioengineered scaffold and the patient's own blood to stimulate healing of the torn ACL ends. Early results are promising for acute tears, but long-term data is still being collected. Currently available at select centers.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="info-card">
                    <h3>Primary ACL Repair</h3>
                    <p>Direct surgical repair of the torn ACL (stitching the ends back together) has historically had poor results. However, with modern techniques and patient selection, it's being revisited for certain tear types.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="info-card">
                    <h3>Biologic Augmentation</h3>
                    <p>Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and stem cell therapies are being studied to enhance healing, though evidence for ACL healing specifically remains limited.</p>
                </div>

                <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> While these are exciting developments, traditional ACL reconstruction remains the gold standard for complete tears in active patients.</p>

                    <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">Key Takeaways</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>A completely torn ACL cannot heal on its own</strong> due to poor blood supply and the synovial fluid environment</li>
                        <li><strong>Not everyone needs surgery</strong>—some people ("copers") can function without an ACL</li>
                        <li><strong>Partial tears</strong> may sometimes be managed conservatively with close monitoring</li>
                        <li><strong>Surgery is usually recommended</strong> for young, active patients wanting to return to cutting/pivoting sports</li>
                        <li><strong>Living without an ACL</strong> increases risk of meniscus damage, cartilage wear, and arthritis</li>
                        <li><strong>A trial of rehabilitation</strong> can help determine if surgery is necessary for you</li>
                        <li><strong>Consult an orthopedic surgeon</strong> to make an informed decision based on your specific situation</li>
                    </ul>
