                            <p class="study-finding">Passing return-to-sport criteria (≥90% LSI) reduced re-injury rate by 84%.</p>
                            <p>This landmark study followed 106 athletes after ACL reconstruction. Those who passed a battery of tests (quad strength, hop tests) before returning to sport had an 84% lower re-injury rate compared to those who didn't pass. Each month delay up to 9 months also reduced risk by 51%.</p>

                            <p class="study-citation">Ithurburn et al., American Journal of Sports Medicine, 2017</p>
                            <p class="study-finding">For every 1% increase in quad strength symmetry, second ACL injury risk decreased by 3%.</p>
                            <p>Quadriceps strength was the single best predictor of successful return without re-injury. Athletes with ≥90% quad LSI had significantly better outcomes than those below threshold.</p>
