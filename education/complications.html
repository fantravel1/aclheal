                        <h2>Arthrofibrosis (Stiffness/Scar Tissue)</h2>

                        <h3>What Is It?</h3>
                        <p>Arthrofibrosis is the formation of excessive scar tissue in the knee joint, leading to loss of range of motion (ROM). It's one of the most common complications after ACL surgery.</p>

                        <h3>Signs and Symptoms</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Inability to fully straighten the knee (extension deficit)</li>
                            <li>Inability to fully bend the knee (flexion deficit)</li>
                            <li>Stiffness that doesn't improve with therapy</li>
                            <li>Pain at end-range of motion</li>
                            <li>Feeling of tightness or "blockage" in the joint</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Risk Factors</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Surgery performed too soon after injury (while knee is still inflamed)</li>
                            <li>Loss of extension before surgery</li>
                            <li>Inadequate early rehabilitation</li>
                            <li>Excessive swelling post-surgery</li>
                            <li>Genetic predisposition to scar tissue formation</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Prevention</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Regain full extension before surgery when possible</li>
                            <li>Prioritize extension exercises immediately post-surgery</li>
                            <li>Aggressive swelling management</li>
                            <li>Consistent physical therapy attendance</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Treatment</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Physical therapy:</strong> Aggressive stretching, mobilization, low-load prolonged stretching</li>
                            <li><strong>Extension splinting:</strong> Wearing a splint to gradually improve extension</li>
                            <li><strong>Manipulation under anesthesia (MUA):</strong> The surgeon moves the knee through ROM while you're asleep</li>
                            <li><strong>Arthroscopic lysis of adhesions:</strong> Surgical removal of scar tissue</li>
                        </ul>

                            <h3>Key Point: Extension is Priority</h3>
                            <p>Full knee extension (0° or better) is critical. Even small extension deficits (3-5°) can cause long-term problems including anterior knee pain and abnormal gait. Don't accept "almost full" extension—work until it matches your other knee.</p>

                        <h2>Graft Failure (Re-Rupture)</h2>

                        <h3>What Is It?</h3>
                        <p>Graft failure occurs when the reconstructed ACL tears or stretches out, resulting in knee instability. This may require revision surgery.</p>

                        <h3>Types of Graft Failure</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Traumatic re-rupture:</strong> New injury tears the graft</li>
                            <li><strong>Graft stretching:</strong> Graft elongates over time, causing gradual instability</li>
                            <li><strong>Failure of incorporation:</strong> Graft doesn't heal properly into bone tunnels</li>
                            <li><strong>Technical failure:</strong> Issues with tunnel placement or graft fixation</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Signs and Symptoms</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>New giving-way episodes</li>
                            <li>Feeling of instability, especially with cutting/pivoting</li>
                            <li>A "pop" during activity (if acute re-rupture)</li>
                            <li>Swelling after the incident</li>
                            <li>Positive Lachman or anterior drawer test on exam</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Risk Factors</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Early return to sport:</strong> Returning before graft fully matured</li>
                            <li><strong>Inadequate rehabilitation:</strong> Weak quads, poor neuromuscular control</li>
                            <li><strong>Poor landing mechanics:</strong> Knee valgus, stiff landings</li>
                            <li><strong>Young age:</strong> Highest re-injury rates in athletes under 25</li>
                            <li><strong>Return to high-risk sports:</strong> Soccer, basketball, football have highest rates</li>
                            <li><strong>Allograft in young athletes:</strong> Higher failure rates than autografts in active young patients</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Prevention</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Wait until meeting all return-to-sport criteria (not just time)</li>
                            <li>Achieve ≥90% quad strength symmetry</li>
                            <li>Pass hop tests with ≥90% LSI</li>
                            <li>Complete sport-specific training before full return</li>
                            <li>Address landing mechanics and neuromuscular control</li>
                            <li>Maintain ongoing strength training after return</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Treatment</h3>
                        <p>If graft failure occurs and instability affects function:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Revision ACL reconstruction:</strong> More complex than primary surgery</li>
                            <li><strong>May require staged procedure:</strong> Bone grafting of tunnels before reconstruction</li>
                            <li><strong>Different graft choice:</strong> Often uses autograft if allograft failed</li>
                            <li><strong>Longer recovery:</strong> Often 18-24 months for return to sport</li>
                        </ul>

                            <h3>Re-injury Statistics</h3>
                            <p>Young athletes returning to Level I sports have a 15-25% chance of second ACL injury (either knee) within 2 years. This risk is highest in the first 2 years after return to sport. Meeting all criteria and maintaining prevention programs reduces this risk.</p>

                        <h2>Cyclops Lesion</h2>

                        <h3>What Is It?</h3>
                        <p>A cyclops lesion is a nodule of fibrous scar tissue that forms in front of the ACL graft. It gets its name from its appearance on MRI—it looks like a single eye. This nodule can block full knee extension.</p>

                        <h3>Signs and Symptoms</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Loss of terminal extension (last few degrees)</li>
                            <li>Mechanical block—feels like something stopping extension</li>
                            <li>Pain at end-range extension</li>
                            <li>Clicking or clunking sensation</li>
                            <li>Extension loss that doesn't improve with therapy</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Clinical exam showing extension deficit with mechanical block</li>

                        </ul>

                        <h3>Treatment</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Arthroscopic excision:</strong> The standard treatment—surgically remove the nodule</li>
                            <li><strong>Usually outpatient:</strong> Minor procedure compared to original surgery</li>
                            <li><strong>Good outcomes:</strong> Most patients regain full extension after excision</li>
                            <li><strong>Early aggressive extension:</strong> Important post-excision to prevent recurrence</li>

                            <p>Cyclops lesions aren't caused by anything you did wrong. They result from how your body healed. If you have a persistent extension block despite good therapy effort, bring it up with your surgeon—a quick arthroscopic procedure often solves the problem.</p>

                        <h2>Other Potential Complications</h2>

                        <h3>Donor Site Pain</h3>
                        <p>If you had an autograft (your own tissue), the harvest site may cause symptoms:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Patellar tendon (BTB):</strong> Anterior knee pain, kneeling discomfort, patellar fracture risk (rare)</li>
                            <li><strong>Hamstring:</strong> Hamstring weakness, cramping, numbness on inner leg</li>
                            <li><strong>Quad tendon:</strong> Quad weakness, suprapatellar discomfort</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Most donor site symptoms improve significantly by 1-2 years, though some residual effects may persist.</p>

                        <h3>Numbness</h3>
                        <p>Numbness around incision sites is common due to small sensory nerves cut during surgery. Most common areas:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Outer knee below kneecap</li>
                            <li>Inner shin (hamstring harvest)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Some sensation may return over 1-2 years, but some permanent numbness is common and usually not problematic.</p>

                        <h3>Blood Clot (DVT)</h3>
                        <p>Deep vein thrombosis is uncommon but serious. Signs include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Calf pain and tenderness</li>
                            <li>Swelling in lower leg (more than expected)</li>
                            <li>Warmth and redness of calf</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>If suspected, seek medical care immediately.</strong> Prevention includes early mobilization and blood thinners if prescribed.</p>

                        <h3>Hardware Problems</h3>
                        <p>Screws and other fixation devices occasionally cause issues:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Hardware irritation (pain over screw site)</li>
                            <li>Screw migration (rare)</li>
                            <li>Hardware removal may be needed if problematic</li>
                        </ul>
