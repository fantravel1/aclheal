                        <h2>Exercise Overview</h2>
                        <p>The clamshell is one of the most effective exercises for activating and strengthening the gluteus medius—a crucial hip stabilizer that helps control knee position during walking, running, and cutting movements.</p>

                            <h3>Why Clamshells Matter for ACL Recovery</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Knee valgus prevention:</strong> Weak hip abductors let the knee collapse inward</li>
                                <li><strong>Glute medius activation:</strong> This muscle often "shuts off" after injury</li>
                                <li><strong>No knee stress:</strong> Safe to start immediately post-op</li>
                                <li><strong>Foundation exercise:</strong> Builds base for all standing activities</li>
                                <li><strong>Injury prevention:</strong> Strong hips reduce re-injury risk</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>The Knee-Hip Connection</h3>
                            <p>Research shows that weak hip abductors are associated with increased knee valgus (inward collapse)—a major risk factor for ACL injuries and re-injuries. Strengthening the glute medius helps keep your knee tracking properly over your foot during dynamic activities.</p>

                                    <h4>Starting Position</h4>
                                    <p>Lie on your side with your head resting on your arm or a pillow. Stack your hips directly on top of each other. Bend both hips to about 45 degrees and both knees to about 90 degrees. Keep your feet together.</p>

                                    <h4>Stabilize Your Core</h4>
                                    <p>Engage your core muscles. Place your top hand on your hip to feel if your pelvis moves—it shouldn't! Your hips should stay stacked throughout.</p>

                                    <h4>Open the Clamshell</h4>
                                    <p>Keeping your feet together, lift your top knee toward the ceiling. Imagine your legs are a clamshell opening. Lift as high as you can without your pelvis rolling backward.</p>

                                <h4>Rolling the Pelvis Back</h4>
                                <p>The most common mistake. If your top hip rolls backward as you lift, you're using momentum and back muscles instead of glutes. Reduce range of motion until you can keep hips stacked.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="mistake-card">

                                <h4>Separating the Feet</h4>
                                <p>Your feet should stay together throughout the movement. If they separate, you're using hip flexors instead of abductors.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="mistake-card">

                                <h4>Going Too Fast</h4>
                                <p>Speed reduces muscle activation. Slow, controlled movements are much more effective for building strength.</p>

                                <h4>Wrong Hip Position</h4>
                                <p>If your hips are bent too much (toward your chest), you'll feel it more in the front of your hip. Keep hips at about 45 degrees.</p>

                                <h4>Ignoring the Surgical Side</h4>
                                <p>You need to work both sides. Lying on your surgical side (to work the non-surgical leg) is usually comfortable with a pillow between knees if needed.</p>

                                <p>You should feel a burning sensation in your outer hip/glute area. If you feel it in your front hip or thigh, adjust your position.</p>
